⚠️⚠️⚠️ KHUYẾN KHÍCH DUAL BOOT VỚI WINDOWS ĐỂ SỬA LỖI ⚠️⚠️⚠️  
Personal stuff, old version was a reference for the current one
I don't know why I host it here on GitHub, there were no DSDT sources (SSDTs are either compiled with SSDTTime or precompiled ones from Acidanthera/Dortania)

## downloads
check releases

## known issues  
Sleep is still partially broken (if you left it for too long)  
Disable Secure Boot while installing (I don't know why), enabling after install works just fine
